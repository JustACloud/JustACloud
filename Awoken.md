Grit of teeth, the taste of blood in my mouth, it was all I could do to steady the tumble my world insisted upon. The drags of wind swept off the deserted landscape, knocking at my flesh to greet my bones. My own forward locomotion contributing to the pure vertigo I'd become assailed by; my valiant efforts to push through malfunctioning senses gaining me an exceptional seat once I'd collapsed into the dirt. 

Only now, free of fighting my own physical symptoms, was I afforded the freedom to think. _When did I get here?_ Her orbs half lidded as the gaze shifts slowly, gaining traction along with her mental acuity. _Where is here for that matter?_ Skies of unfamiliar stars and constellations draped her with their luminosity, their obscure abyss daring her to tread these unsafe waters. 

The more I struggle to find my name the more uneasy I feel, I daresay queasy. Names that somehow all feel so _right_ to fit me also leave a discomfort if I settle on them for too long. I try to keep them all in order, but it feels like volcanic hurricane inside my head now. I shouldn't focus on this, but it's my name dammit!

Everything falls still except my ragged breath, my ears ring against the hollow silence that stole the wind. Finally I can push my knees away from my chest, I took a sharp inhale of the sharper, frigid air before rolling to my knees and standing.
